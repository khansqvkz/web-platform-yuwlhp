      <h1>Ruby's Coding Quest: A Digital Adventure</h1>

      <div>
        <body>
          Once upon a time, in a pixelated kingdom far, far away, there lived a
          curious coder named Ruby. Ruby spent her days crafting lines of code,
          weaving digital spells into existence. One sunny morning, as she
          sipped her virtual coffee, a message popped up on her screen. It was
          an invitation to a coding contest in the enchanted forest.

      </div>

      <div>
        <span>Excited by the challenge</span>, Ruby embarked on a journey
        through the tangled branches of the forest, her fingers dancing across
        the keyboard. Along the way, she encountered quirky creatures made of
        ones and zeros, who shared cryptic clues and riddles.

       <div>

      <div>
        <span>With determination in her heart</span>, Ruby deciphered each
        puzzle, leveraging her coding skills to overcome obstacles. As the sun
        dipped below the horizon, she reached the clearing where the contest
        awaited.

      </div>

      <div>
        Ruby needed to prepare for the contest, so she made a list:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">Debug</a> her code
            for efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Master new
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding">coding</a>
            techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gather provisions for the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey">journey</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Under the twinkling stars, Ruby faced off against fellow coders, each
        vying for the title of <span>Coding Champion</span>. The competition was
        fierce, but Ruby remained steadfast, her code flowing like poetry.

      </div>

      <div>
        <span>In the end, it wasn't just about winning</span>; it was about the
        joy of creation, the thrill of problem-solving, and the camaraderie of
        fellow coders. As the contest drew to a close, Ruby emerged victorious,
        her name glowing brightly atop the leaderboard.

      <div>
        And so, with a satisfied smile and <span>a heart full of code</span>,
        Ruby returned home, ready to embark on her next coding adventure.
