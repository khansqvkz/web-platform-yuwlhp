          ax had always dreamed of the perfect Sunday: cozy bed, snacks within
          reach, and every streaming service at his fingertips. Today, that
          dream was finally coming true. He had stocked up on popcorn, candy,
          and enough soda to float a small boat.

          Wrapped in his softest blanket, he flicked on the TV and sank into the
          cushions. "This," he thought, "is heaven."

          Just as Max found the perfect movie, his phone buzzed. It was a
          message from his friend Lisa: "Ready for our 5K run?" Max's eyes
          widened in horror.

        <div class="bottom-right-text">
          He had completely forgotten! With a groan, he looked from the TV to
          his running shoes by the door. "Well," he sighed, "it seemed like
          heaven... while it lasted!"
